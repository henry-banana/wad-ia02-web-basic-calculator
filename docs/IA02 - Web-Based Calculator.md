# Project: Build a Web-Based Calculator (Basic Mode ‚Äì Windows 11 Equivalent)

---

# üìò Objective

You are required to develop a **web-based calculator** that replicates the **Basic Mode** functionality of the Windows 11 Calculator.  
 The calculator should support standard arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, percentage, square root, etc.), follow **modern web development practices**, and be implemented as either a **single-page web application (SPA)** or a **pure JavaScript app**.

---

# üß± Technical Requirements

You may choose **one** of the following development approaches:

* **Option 1:** Build using **Raw HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**

* **Option 2:** Build using a **modern SPA framework** (e.g., React, Vue, Svelte)

Your application must:

* Run fully in the **browser** (no backend).

* Have a **user-friendly interface** similar to Windows 11 Basic Mode.

* Be **responsive** and **visually organized**.

* Be **publicly hosted** on a platform such as:

  * GitHub Pages

  * Netlify

  * Vercel

  * Firebase Hosting

  * or any other public hosting provider

The hosted link must be included in your documentation.

---

# üìÅ Submission Requirements

Your documentation must include the following sections:

## üß∞ Functional Specifications

* Purpose and scope of your calculator.

* Full list of supported features (same as Windows 11 Basic Mode).

* Description of how user inputs, operators, and the display are handled.

* Include any assumptions (e.g., rounding, operator order).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Non-Functional Specifications

* Performance (quick response, smooth updates).

* Usability (clear layout, accessible for users).

* Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari).

* Responsiveness (desktop & mobile support).

* Reliability and maintainability.

## ‚úÖ Acceptance Criteria

* Arithmetic operations return correct results.

* Operator precedence is correctly applied.

* CE, C, and Backspace behave as in Windows Calculator.

* Display updates accurately after each input.

* Design remains stable across browsers and devices.

* **Deployed version is publicly accessible and functional.**

## üß™ Testing Plan

* Explain the testing method (manual or automated).

* Provide **test cases** for all main features, including:

  * Input

  * Expected Output

  * Actual Output

  * Result (Pass/Fail)

* Include example cases such as:

  * `2 + 3 =` ‚Üí `5`

  * `‚àö9 =` ‚Üí `3`

  * `10 %` ‚Üí behaves as 10% of current operand

## üß† Prompt Engineering (AI Assistance)

* Include any **AI prompts** used for code or documentation generation.

* Explain how AI helped in your development process (e.g., idea generation, debugging).

* Reflect on what you learned from using AI.

* All AI-generated content must be **reviewed and verified** by you.

# üóÇÔ∏è Submission Format

Submit a **ZIP file** containing:

1. **Source code** of your web-based calculator.

2. **Documentation file** (`.pdf` or `.docx`) including all sections above.

3. The **public hosting link** clearly stated in the document.

üëâ Follow the **submission instructions in the previous *Course Introduction* slide** for file naming and upload procedures.

---

# üí° AI Assistance Policy

You **may use AI tools** (e.g., ChatGPT, GitHub Copilot, Gemini) to help:

* Write documentation

* Generate or debug code

* Design UI or test cases

However:

* You **must review** and **take full responsibility** for all generated content.

* Clearly mark which sections involved AI assistance.

* Submissions with unreviewed AI content will lose marks.
